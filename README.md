This website was designed and developed using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end of the website was built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. HTML is used for creating the structure of the web pages, CSS is used for designing the visual appearance of the pages, and Bootstrap is used for making the website responsive and mobile-friendly.

On the other hand, the back-end of the website was built using Django, a powerful and versatile web framework that allows for efficient development of complex web applications. Django provides a range of tools and features that enable developers to quickly create scalable, maintainable, and secure web applications.

To store user destinations and contact information, PostgreSQL was used as the database management system. PostgreSQL is a reliable and robust open-source database that provides advanced features like concurrency control, transaction management, and data integrity.

Additionally, this website provides several features to its users, including registration, login, and logout options. Users can register for an account by providing their personal information and create a profile. Once logged in, users can access their profile, manage their account settings, and view their saved destinations.
